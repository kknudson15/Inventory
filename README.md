# Inventory
This project utilizes Binary search trees to work with an inventory.  This program uses a menu driven system in the client program to allow a user to manipulate a binary  tree that implements an ordered list ADT.  The various functions associated with the  tree are used throughout this program to demonstrate this type of implementation.  The  class methods rely heavily upon recursion to traverse the tree.
